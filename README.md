*The repository has two videos in the Circuit Videos file, one that demonstrates our circuit working with all of the states and components, the other that gives an overview of the different components that make up our circuit. For the highest quality versions of those videos, please refer to the drive links in the design document.*

This project was assigned as the final for CPE301 (Embedded Systems Design).

Our project was to build and code an Arduino circuit that contained a temperature and humidity sensor, a water sensor, a vent with a motor to open and close it, with button controls, a motor with a fan attached, an LCD display for readings, a real-time clock, and LEDs which display a different color for each of the four different states that the circuit can be in. This is also displayed, with the time, in the serial monitor. 

We initially began this project by creating the GitHub and adding code from previous labs that we were familiar with. This was mostly to initialize registers and pins for things such as the ADC, UART, LCD, the lights, and the buttons. After compiling some of the necessary code in one place, we met up together to assemble the circuit, and work on some harder parts of the code. This was where we figured out the state changes, the sensors, and the display. We separately worked on pieces of the circuit as well, like the interrupts and the real-time clock module. A lot of this process consisted of individually testing pieces of the final circuit, before adding it to the complete thing. 

The design document included in the submission contains all of our design information, system constraints, pictures of every area of the circuit, the videos that show the circuit in its working condition and all of its components, a complete schematic drawing of the circuit and the connections, and specification sheets.
